        <p>Step 1: Assemble all required materials</p><br>
        <p>Assemble all the necessary materials and equipment needed; grafted 
            mango seedling(s) manure and or fertilizer, watering can and water, 
            spade and a hoe.</p><br>


        <p>Step 2: Selection of seedlings for planting</p><br>
        <p>It is important to identify and select seedlings that are healthy and big 
            enough for planting as they have a higher chance of survival. Quality 
            planting material (grafted) is important for good production/ high yields. 
            Selected seedlings should not show signs of pests and diseases.</p><br>

        <p>Step 3: Transportation of seedlings for planting</p><br>
        <p>Different means of transporting seedlings are used, depending on the 
            distance from the nursery to the identified planting site. During
            transportation of seedlings, take caution not to pile them up on each as 
            this can cause damage to the young trees. It is recommended that the 
            seedlings are transported upright in boxes, plastic crates or bags as this 
            will reduce the chance of damaging them.</p><br>

        <p>Step 4: Land preparation and planting</p>

            <p>An ideal climate for mango trees ranges from the humid tropical to the 
                semi-arid subtropical, wherever a dry period exists of at least 3 to 4 
                months and that have sufficient light to induce flowering.</p>
            <p>Spacing between mango trees varies from variety to variety and growing 
                environment (dry and wet zone). In dry zone the spacing varies from 10 
                m x 10 m, because the vegetative growth is limited, while in wet and rich 
                soils the preferred spacing is12 m x 12 m, because of abundant vegetative 
                growth.</p>
            <p>Planting holes should be dug before the onset of a rainy season where 
                possible for water to collect in it to enhance the survival of the seedling 
                planted. The holes should be dug to a depth of 1 meter, width of 1 meter 
                and length of 1 meter (1m x 1m x 1m).
                </p>
            <p>The spacing of these holes should consider the mango tree canopy as well 
                as the soil fertility of the area.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 10%"><u>Management of fruit tree after planting</u></h2><br>
        <h3><u>Irrigation</u></h3>
        <p>Watering should be done immediately after planting in the field to foster
            proper establishment.</p>
        <p>If possible; you can water your mango tree at interval of 8 to 12 days 
            from when the mango tree start to produce flowers to maturity so as to 
            have higher yields.</p>
        <p>Note; watering is not recommended 2 to 3 months before flowering as it 
            will encourage increased branching and leaves development.
            </p>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Protection</u></h3>
        <p>Where the fruit tree is planted on an open field particularly where 
            animals are also grazed, it is advisable to protect the fruit tree against 
            destruction by livestock, especially goats, by building a fence of sticks/ 
            net around the planted fruit tree.</p>
        <br>
        <h3><u>Manure and Fertilizer application</u></h3>
        <p>After about 3-6 months, start application of nitrogenous fertilizers (in 
            case of fruit trees e.g. mango, pawpaw, oranges). Apply nitrogenous 
            fertilizers in varied intervals to avoid leaching out (downward movement 
            of useful mineral or nutrients in water). Alternatively, properly prepared 
            farm yard manure or compost, kitchen ash (left from cooking) and 
            mulching can be used in place of fertilizers.
            </p>

    <div style="margin: 0 6% 0 6%">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 10%"><u>Pruning and training</u></h3>
        <p>The height and form of the fruit tree needs to be controlled. This is meant 
            to guide the tree and facilitate its harvesting at its later stages. It is
            advisable that you carry out pruning in the first year to guide tree into 
            desired shape, and when trees are about 1 m from the ground, cap seedling 
            to encourage side branches. Carry out pruning later for proper tree
            maintenance and should be carried out after fruit harvest. Control height 
            to about 3.5 m and all branches at knee level (about 0.5m) be pruned. 
            Remove all dead branches to allow sunlight through canopy to the ground 
            under the tree.
            </p>
            <br>
        <h3><u>Flowering and fruit formation</u></h3>
        <p>Grafted fruit trees usually start to flower within two years from planting. 
            However, fruit formation should be discouraged at this stage as it can 
            affect growth of the fruit tree. For grafted mangoes, it is advisable that 
            fruit formation is allowed from the fourth year onwards.</p>
            <br>
        <h3><u>Pests and diseases</u></h3>
        <p>Fruit fly is the most common pests for mangoes and other fruits usually 
            causing a lot of damage to and high losses of these fruits. The use of fruit 
            fly traps is popular method of controlling fruit fly among other ways. 
            Other pests include gall midges and scales insects. Powdery mildew and 
            anthracnose are the most common mango diseases mainly affecting the 
            flowers, tender leaves and leading to development of black lesions on 
            mango fruits. Powdery mildew can be controlled by spraying using 
            Sulphur or Bayleton, while anthracnose can be controlled using copper
            fungicides.</p>
